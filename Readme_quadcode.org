workflow for running a quadrant analysis:

* 1) pick a non-dimensional target time and edit the variable
time_nd_target in calc_index.py.  Run this with

python calc_index.py to produce a json file with the run dictionary

for example:  if time_nd_target = 300  the output file will be called

index_list_time_nd_300.json

* 2) Run Flux_Quads.py to get an hdf5 file with all ensembles for every case that
    has that time index:

python Flux_Quads.py -j index_list_time_nd_300.json  -r may26_300

produces the file:

profiles_may26_300.h5

The file structure can be examined by doing:

./h5dump.py profiles_may26_300.h5 

* 3) to do the quadrant conditional averages, run

python quad_profiles.py -p profiles_may26_300.h5 -o flux_out_300.h5

* 4) to make the plots, run

python plot_h5profs.py -q flux_out_300.h5

for any of the scripts  do

python script_name.py --help to get help
