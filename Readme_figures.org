** working with [[file:~/repos/Sam_Output_Anls/ML_Height_Hist.py]]  on branch phil
   (figure 4 histograms)

** get Garcia Mellado scaling from [[file:~/repos/Sam_Output_Anls/gm_numbers.py]]
   this writes paper_table.h5 with cases

** applied new scaling to [[file:~/repos/Sam_Output_Anls/plot_downwarm_h.py]]
   (figure 5 timeseries)
   reads from paper_table.h5

** look at vertical profiles using figure 6 code:
    plot_theta_profs.py  96c220

** look at Richardson numbers using 
   get_limits and plot_heights
